    <h2 class='disease-title'> Influenza</h2>
    <p id='desc_0' class='disease-description'>The Influenza is also the contagious illness that spreads through the
        respiratory droplets. This could also happen when the infected person sneezes, or talks or coughs, or sneezes.
        As a result, it could spreads rapidly in the crowded places such as the offices, the schools, the market, any
        public transportation with other areas in high population density. Although in the influenza cases in the India
        can also occur throughout a year, the flu virus would typically spread during winter months, in the month of
        November to February, or after a monsoon season.</p>

<div class='disease-box' onclick='toggleDescription("desc_1")' style='background-color: #e0e0e0;'>
    <h2 class='disease-title'>Acidity</h2>
    <p id='desc_1' class='disease-description'>Our stomach produces gastric acids to help digestion. However, their
        corrosive effects are neutralised by producing natural bicarbonate and prostaglandins secreted in the mucous
        lining. When the production of these chemicals is interrupted, it leads to damaged stomach lining, which causes
        acidity. GERD occurs more commonly in people who are:
        Overweight or obese because of high pressure on the abdomen
        Pregnant because of the high abdominal pressure
        Taking certain medications, including certain asthma medications, Ca channel blockers, antihistamines,
        sedatives, and antidepressants
        Smoking and being exposed to second-hand smoke
        Consumption of excess tea or coffee
        Complications such as GERD are treated with a combination of lifestyle modifications and pharmacological therapy
        such as proton pump inhibitors and H2 receptor antagonist. Surgery is required in severe cases where
        pharmacological therapy does not show any positive response.</p>
</div>
<div class='disease-box' onclick='toggleDescription("desc_2")' style='background-color: #f5f5f5;'>
    <h2 class='disease-title'>Acute leukemia</h2>
    <p id='desc_2' class='disease-description'>This is the most common cause of cancer in children and teens which
        affects the white blood cells. Abnormal white blood cells from the bone marrow travel through the blood stream
        and cover up the healthy cells. This increases the chance of infection and susceptibility to other diseases due
        to a weak immune system. Though the exact cause of childhood leukemia is not known, but one may have various
        risk factors. Children with siblings with leukemia stand a higher chance to get one, if your child is being
        treated with immuno-suppressants or have been exposed to high radiation it contributes being as a risk factor.
        One cannot ignore the genetic risk factors too, which you can hardly defy. Excessive fatigue, infection and high
        fever, recurrent cough should make you alert and get your baby checked.</p>

<div class='disease-box' onclick='toggleDescription("desc_3")' style='background-color: #e0e0e0;'>
    <h2 class='disease-title'>Appendicitis</h2>
    <p id='desc_3' class='disease-description'>Appendicitis the inflammation and swelling of the appendix, a small tube
        like structure protruding from the large intestine. It occurs when the appendix gets blocked with stool or
        foreign particles passing through the intestine. Blockage may cause infection which results in painful swelling
        of the appendix. The initial symptom of appendicitis is pain in the lower abdominal region on the right hand
        side. The pain is sharp and intense. It originates from the navel (middle of the abdomen) and gradually starts
        worsening over 6-24 hours. Appendectomy remains the only curative treatment of appendicitis but antibiotics do
        play an important role in the treatment of patients with this acute appendicitis. The duration of the
        administration of antibiotics is closely related to the stage of appendicitis at the time of the diagnosis. If
        diagnosis of appendicitis takes a longer time, the pain may become severe as the infection spreads. If not
        treated at the right time, the appendix may burst to release the pus to surrounding areas, which can be
        life-threatening. Sometimes, a tender mass of pus (abscess) may form around the burst appendix.</p>

<div class='disease-box' onclick='toggleDescription("desc_4")' style='background-color: #f5f5f5;'>
    <h2 class='disease-title'>Asthma</h2>
    <p id='desc_4' class='disease-description'>Asthma is a lung disorder that affects your airways and causes difficulty
        in breathing. It is triggered by inflammation of the air passages. The inflammation causes the air passages to
        become narrow. The narrowness is indicated by the noisy and whistling breathing, shortness of breath, chest
        tightness and coughing.

        There can be several triggers or factors that can aggravate the symptoms of asthma. Common factors include dust,
        mites, pollen, smoke, pollution, weather change, cold & cough and respiratory infections. Asthma can be broadly
        classified into two categories - specific and non-specific. Specific asthma hits you when you breathe in
        allergens or irritants, while non-specific asthma is caused by exercise, weather conditions or genetic
        predisposition. The exact cause of asthma is not known, but it is seen in families with a history of the
        condition. Asthma cannot be cured, but it can be managed well with several treatment options to relieve the
        symptoms and prevent severe attacks. </p>

    <h2 class='disease-title'>Back pain</h2>
    <p id='desc_5' class='disease-description'>Back pain refers to the pain arising in back and usually arises from the
        muscles, joints, nerves, or other structures in the spine. Back pain is a fairly common condition that most
        people suffer from these days. Medically the condition is as one where the person experiences pain or discomfort
        in any part of the back. Incidentally, the lower back is a place where most people suffer from pain, commonly
        caused due to improper posture or strain.

        Back pain is something most of us suffer from at some point in our lives. While some aches may be acute (sudden
        and quick to subside) others may be the start of a chronic condition. Here is all you need to know about back
        pain and what it could probably indicate.</p>
</div>
<div class='disease-box' onclick='toggleDescription("desc_6")' style='background-color: #f5f5f5;'>
    <h2 class='disease-title'>Bad Breath</h2>
    <p id='desc_6' class='disease-description'>Bad breath or Halitosis is a term used to describe noticeably unpleasant
        odours exhaled in breathing. According to scientists smelling one’s own breath is not a good enough method to
        detect foul breath. This is because most people get ‘acclimatized’ to their own bad breath but can successfully
        identify it in others. Some useful self diagnosis methods involves asking some one close to tell you if you are
        suffering from bad breath. Another method is to lick the back of your wrist and smell the saliva. Although these
        methods may cause you to ‘overestimate’ the severity of your trouble, it’s better to be safe than sorry. You can
        eat foods like apples, cloves, fennel seeds to prevent bad breath. Additionally, maintaining good oral hygiene
        will go a long way in ensuring that you don't experience bad breath.</p>

<div class='disease-box' onclick='toggleDescription("desc_7")' style='background-color: #e0e0e0;'>
    <h2 class='disease-title'>Bell's Palsy</h2>
    <p id='desc_7' class='disease-description'>Bell's palsy, a neurological disorder, may affect men and women of any
        age, but statistics suggest that the condition is more likely to strike those above forty. Diabetics and people
        with a compromised immune system are at a greater risk of suffering from the condition. Other factors that can
        up your risk of Bell's palsy include pregnancy, lung infection and a family history of the condition.

        Bell's palsy is a condition that leads to temporary weakness or paralysis of the facial nerves. Inflammation or
        compression of the nerves responsible for controlling the muscles of your face can trigger this condition.
        Bell's palsy causes one side of your face to sag or become stiff. So, your lip and eye movements become
        restricted on the side of your face affected by this condition. Named after Scottish anatomist Charles Bell, the
        first to be affected by Bell's palsy, this condition doesn't last for long. The symptoms resolve within a few
        weeks. Rarely, it relapses.</p>

<div class='disease-box' onclick='toggleDescription("desc_8")' style='background-color: #f5f5f5;'>
    <h2 class='disease-title'>Bipolar disorder</h2>
    <p id='desc_8' class='disease-description'>Bipolar disorder is a mood disorder, wherein the affected person
        experiences extreme changes in mood, energy, concentration, activity levels and the ability to perform their
        daily tasks. The mood changes range from periods of depression (feelings of hopelessness, sadness or
        indifference) to mania (energised, irritable or elated behaviour). The condition can occur in adults as well as
        in children and adolescents. However, the average age of onset is estimated to be about 25 years. Mood
        fluctuations in individuals with bipolar disorder can affect their relationship with loved ones, friends and
        colleagues. Early identification of the condition, following the prescribed treatment plan and maintaining a
        healthy lifestyle can help individuals with bipolar disorder lead a normal life. Symptoms that may occur during
        manic episodes include:
        Increased energy
        Elevated mood
        Increased physical and mental activity
        Racing thoughts and speech
        Poor judgement
        Decreased need for sleep
        Erratic driving and increased recklessness
        Treatment: Although there is no definitive cure for bipolar disorder, the following treatment options help to
        manage and control the symptoms:
        Medications: The doctor will prescribe certain medicines to control the symptoms. The following classes of drugs
        may be prescribed:
        Antipsychotics (control the symptoms)
        Mood stabilisers (reduce the symptoms and prevent relapse)
        Antidepressants (rarely used due to their tendency to trigger manic episodes or rapid cycling)
        Anti-anxiety medicines (decrease the agitation occurring with manic episodes and instil a feeling of
        calmness)</p>

<div class='disease-box' onclick='toggleDescription("desc_9")' style='background-color: #e0e0e0;'>
    <h2 class='disease-title'>Bowel Cancer</h2>
    <p id='desc_9' class='disease-description'>This cancer occurs when the cells of your large intestine (rectum and
        colon) grow and divide abnormally, leading to malignant tumours. Typically, bowel cancer starts with small,
        benign clumps of cells known as polyps. They develop on the inside lining of the colon and become cancerous over
        time if left untreated. Like all other cancers, bowel cancer also has four stages. Several factors like genetic
        mutation, age and lifestyle issues like sedentary habits, smoking and excessive alcohol intake may increase your
        chance of getting bowel cancer.

        Bowel Cancer Symptoms
        This cancer may not show any symptom at the initial stage. However, the manifestations may become noticeable as
        the condition progresses. The symptoms of bowel cancer may vary depending on the size and location of the
        tumour. Here are a few red flags to watch out for:
        Persistent diarrhoea or constipation
        Bleeding rectum
        Blood in the stool
        Gas, cramps, or discomfort in the abdomen
        Heavy feeling in the tummy
        Unexplained fatigue or weight loss
        Long-term change in the colour, consistency and shape of your stool
        Irritable bowel syndrome
        Iron deficiency

    <h2 class='disease-title'>Breast cancer</h2>
    <p id='desc_10' class='disease-description'>Breast cancer is a condition where breast cells divide and multiply
        uncontrollably due to mutation in certain genes. Generally, cancer forms in the milk-producing glands (lobules)
        of the breast or in the pathways (ducts)transporting the milk from glands to nipple. Fatty or the fibrous
        connective tissues of the breast can also be the hotspot for cancerous cells. In some cases, cancer cells may
        travel to the lymph nodes under your arms and spread to different parts of the body.</p>

<div class='disease-box' onclick='toggleDescription("desc_11")' style='background-color: #e0e0e0;'>
    <h2 class='disease-title'>Burns</h2>
    <p id='desc_11' class='disease-description'>Burns are categorized as a type of damage to the skin and its underlying
        tissues. Most skin burns are minor injuries that usually occur at work or home. Although kids are more prone to
        such incidents, adults are no different. Burns are characterized by a burning sensation around the injured area
        and severe skin damage. Although minor burns caused by spilling of hot water or touching a hot stove can be
        treated at home, more serious burns require urgent medical attention to prevent complications.

        Severe burns can cause severe or life-long complications. One of the most concerning problems is the body's
        inflammatory response to burns. A typical response protects the body from offenders like bacteria and virus.
        Yes, often for severe burns, the body's immune system may overreact, causing injury to be more powerful and
        affects various organs like the heart and lungs. Shock is also something that can take place in case of a severe
        drop in blood pressure. Infections are also a significant concern in burn victims and need critical and timely
        care to recover. Untreated infections may result in sepsis.</p>

    <h2 class='disease-title'>Cancer</h2>
    <p id='desc_12' class='disease-description'>Cancer is caused by unchecked cell growth in the body. Cancer is one of
        India's leading causes of death, with approximately 1.16 million new cases diagnosed each year. The three most
        common cancers in India are breast, lung, and cervical cancer.
        Smoking, drinking alcohol, eating a lot of processed and red meat, and being exposed to toxins from the
        environment are all cancer risk factors in India. Although it is frequently difficult to find high-quality
        cancer care in India, early diagnosis and treatment can lead to better results.</p>

    <p id='desc_13' class='disease-description'>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is any disease involving the heart or blood
        vessels.[3] CVDs constitute a class of diseases that includes: coronary artery diseases (e.g. angina, heart
        attack), heart failure, hypertensive heart disease, rheumatic heart
        disease, cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, congenital heart disease, valvular heart disease, carditis, aortic

    <h2 class='disease-title'>Cataracts</h2>
    <p id='desc_14' class='disease-description'>The crystalline lens of the eye is clear and transparent. The lens
        focuses the light into the retina to create a sharp image, which helps people see objects clearly. In certain
        circumstances, the lens develops cloudiness or opacity. This obstructs light from being transmitted into the
        retina, causing blurring of vision. This condition is known as a cataract. Usually, cataracts do not cause any
        problems at an early stage as the cloudiness affects only a small part of the lens. But, as the cataract grows,
        they affect more parts of the lens, making it difficult for a patient to see objects. Both eyes usually get
        affected, but cataracts do not spread from one eye to another. A cataract might progress quicker in one eye than
        the other.</p>

    <h2 class='disease-title'>Cervix cancer</h2>
    <p id='desc_15' class='disease-description'>Cervical cancer has beaten breast cancer as the leading cause of cancer
        deaths in women in India; it kills around 33,000 women every year in India. Cervical cancer is known to occur
        because of a virus called the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) transmitted through sexual contact. Bad local hygiene,
        too many children, not enough spacing between children, low nutrition levels and early marriage all contribute
        to the risk factors. The high risk group includes girls who have had premature sex as teenagers, those who have
        had multiple pregnancies or multiple sex partners and don't use contraceptives. The disease remains asymptomatic
        for a long time till it starts invading neighbouring tissues. Cervical cancer is the commonest cancer in Indian
        women and a quarter of the world's cervical cancer patients live in India!Caused by infection with the Human
        Papilloma Virus( HPV), cervical cancer involves the opening of the uterus into the vagina. It occurs more
        commonly in women who start sexual activity at a young age and is also more common in women with many
        childbirths and partners. </p>

    <h2 class='disease-title'>Chicken Pox</h2>
    <p id='desc_16' class='disease-description'>The typical chickenpox symptom is a rash that develops into painful,
        fluid-filled blisters that eventually crust over to form scabs. The rash may initially appear on the face, back,
        and chest before spreading to every part of the body, including the genital area, eyelids, and inside of the
        mouth. Typically, it takes a week or so for every blister to turn into a scab.</p>

    <h2 class='disease-title'>Chronic respiratory diseases</h2>
    <p id='desc_17' class='disease-description'>Chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs) affect the airways and other
        structures of the lungs. Some of the most common are chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma,
        occupational lung diseases and pulmonary hypertension. In addition to tobacco smoke, other risk factors include
        air pollution, occupational chemicals and dusts, and frequent lower respiratory infections during childhood.
        CRDs are not curable; however, various forms of treatment that help open the air passages and improve shortness
        of breath can help control symptoms and improve daily life for people living with these conditions. The WHO
        Global Alliance against CRDs (GARD) vision is “a world in which all people breathe freely”. GARD focuses on the
        needs of people with CRDs in low- and middle-income countries. The aim of the WHO Chronic Respiratory Diseases
        Programme is to support Member States in their efforts to reduce the toll of morbidity, disability and premature
        mortality related to chronic respiratory diseases, specifically asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary
        disease.</p>

    <h2 class='disease-title'>Cirrhosis</h2>
    <p id='desc_18' class='disease-description'>In this condition, scar tissue replaces your healthy liver cells. Caused
        by an infection of alcohol addiction, cirrhosis takes time to develop. Build-up of scar tissues blocks blood
        flow to the liver and impairs its functions. The liver of a person with cirrhosis cannot produce protein and
        other substances, process hormones and nutrients or filter out toxins. Though there is no cure for the
        condition, spotting the symptoms early on will help you manage it better. Symptoms are: Lack of appetite and
        weight loss, Nausea
        Swollen ankles and legs (caused by fluid and salt retention), Frequent bleeding and bruising,Redness in the
        hands and palms, Yellowing of skin and eyes (jaundice), Itchy skin, Poor memory, Lack of concentration, Low

    <h2 class='disease-title'>Cleft lip and palate</h2>
    <p id='desc_19' class='disease-description'>Cleft lip and/or palate are the most common birth defects of the mouth.
        A cleft lip occurs when the two Structures or processes that make up the lip do not completely fuse before
        birth. Usually, a cleft lip and palate are identifiable at birth and may affect one or both sides of the face.
        It might appear as a small notch in the lip that extends via the upper gum into the bottom of the nasal septum.
        However, in some cases, cleft occurs at the back of the mouth (which in turn is covered by the mouth lining). In
        this type of cleft lip and palate, you might experience signs such as difficulty in swallowing, speaking (nasal
        voice) and a high risk of ear infections. Cleft lip or cleft palate requires treatment from a number of medical
        specialists from various specialities. This cleft team will include the following members.
        Paediatrician
        Plastic surgeon to perform surgeries
        Pediatric speech pathologist
        Audiologist to monitor hearing

    <h2 class='disease-title'>Colour blindness</h2>
    <p id='desc_20' class='disease-description'>Colour blindness is a condition where a person cannot figure out the
        difference between certain colours. This happens because he/she may be born without certain colour sensitive
        pigments in their eyes. These pigments are usually present in the cones of the eye, which are present at the
        back of the eyeball.
        The eye has a number of components, and one of the most important parts of the eye is the retina. The retina is
        placed at the back of the eyeball and is packed with nerve endings that carry impulses to the brain along with
        two types of photoreceptor cells, called the rods and cones. Colour-blindness is a hereditary condition that
        affects mostly the male population. The gene that causes colour-blindness is present on the X chromosome. Since
        women have two X chromosomes and men have only one, they are more likely to suffer from the condition.
        Although colour-blindness is usually an inherited disease, there are certain conditions of the eye that could
        lead to colour-blindness. Conditions such as cataract can lead to 'acquired colour-blindness'. Usually, a
        person's vision comes back to normal once the condition has been reversed with surgery.
        Damage to the brain or eye can also cause colour blindness. Medications that harm the eye can also lead to this
        eye disorder.</p>

        Currently, this illness poses a risk to about half of the world's population.

        There is a virus that causes dengue fever. People contract the virus by mosquito bites, specifically from the
        Aedes species.A serious flu-like condition is brought on by dengue fever. It could resemble other illnesses like

        , Lose bowel or bladder control. The doctors may find it difficult to quickly diagnose epilepsy as other
        conditions such as migraines and fainting occur with similar symptoms. In most cases, epilepsy is diagnosed only
        when the person has had at least two seizures. Blood tests: It is performed to rule out possible causes of
        seizures such as diabetes or low blood sugar.
        Electroencephalogram (EEG): This test records the brain's electrical activity.
        Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): This test takes images of the brain and helps to confirm epilepsy as the cause
        of seizures.
        Video EEG: This test records a video while conducting a regular EEG. The video recording is performed in the
        hospital where the doctor closely monitors an individual's behaviour during a seizure.</p>

    <p id='desc_25' class='disease-description'>Fatty liver disease is a silent medical condition, which means there are
        usually no symptoms. In such cases, the disease is identified from routine health check up indicating fatty
        liver with ultrasound, CT scan or MRI of the abdomen. Patients should visit the doctor for further
        investigations even if they do not have any symptoms. In case you experience the following symptoms, visit the
        doctor. Fatigue, General feeling of being unwell, Right sided upper abdominal discomfort. Diagnosis: Blood test:
        Some liver enzymes act as markers which can be detected using liver function tests. Some liver enzymes such as
        SGOT (aspartate transaminase -AST) and SGPT (alanine transaminase- ALT) might be elevated. Blood tests exclude
        other causes of fatty liver including blood sugar, lipid profile and thyroid function tests. They also check for
        viral hepatitis B and C which co exist in some patients with fatty liver disease without producing any symptoms.
        Ultrasound of the abdomen: Ultrasound uses sound waves to detect structural abnormalities of the liver. A fatty
        liver will appear 'echogenic,'' more dense than usual, when visualised through ultrasound. Fibroscan: It is a
        non-invasive test similar to ultrasound that gives valuable information about the liver and helps quantify the
        amount of fat and degree of scarring (fibrosis ) in the liver. It takes few minutes to perform, is painless and
        result is available immediately.</p>

        may be caused when the bones get weak because of conditions such as osteoporosis, brittle bone disease,
        osteomalacia, and bone tumours. The symptoms vary depending on the type of fracture. These include -
        Displaced or non-displaced: A person with a displaced fracture will notice a disfigurement (a small protrusion)
        of the area that is fractured. For a non-displaced fracture, one will only notice a swelling in the region.
        Open or closed fracture: The open fracture is the easiest to identify because of the wound seen on the person's
        skin. For the closed fracture, one will be able to see the broken bone pushing through the skin.
        Greenstick fracture: Usually associated with immense pain and inability to use the fractured part, a greenstick
        fracture requires considerable care and attention. The person will not notice the usual deformity seen with
        other fractures.
        Comminuted fracture: A person with this fracture type will notice bruising, pain and swelling. The person might
        hear a snap or a crack when the bone breaks. There might be certain disfigurement of the area.
        Stress fracture: Here the patient will experience symptoms such as dull aching pain that gradually develops: one
        that increases with weight-bearing activity and goes away with rest, pain and tenderness around the area of the
        fracture.
        Pathological fracture: In this type of fracture, the person will experience sudden symptoms associated with that
        particular type of fracture while he/she might be experiencing pain along the region of the break for a while
        (usually associated with the weakening of the bones)
        In addition to all these specific symptoms as per the type of the common symptoms that are reported these are

        The reasons behind the frozen shoulder condition are unknown. However, it may occur because of immobilization of
        the shoulder for a long, long time due to injury, surgery, or illness. In many cases, the cause is obscure.
        However, with proper treatment, you can usually unfreeze the shoulder. The recovery takes time and patience. The

        and enzymes to carry out digestion. This inflammation can either last for a short while (acute gastritis) or may
        continue to affect your digestive system for a long time (chronic gastritis). Risk factors of gastritis include
        stress and obesity. A person who has had a past gastrointestinal surgery is also at risk of developing the
        condition. Besides, some diseases like zollinger Ellison disease in which there is an increase in stomach acid

        there are few factors that cause gum disease such as -
        Lack of oral hygiene: It is one of the most common causes of gum disease. Poor oral hygiene causes plaque and
        tartar to get deposited on your teeth, causing irritation in the gums thereby leading to gum disease.
        Dental problems: Some of the common dental issues such as improper position of teeth, faulty or irritating tooth
        fillings and dentures, partially impacted wisdom tooth and a missing tooth can cause gum disease.
        Diabetes: If your blood sugar levels are not within control, you are more likely to get gum disease. Although
        the exact reason is still unknown, there has been a strong relation between diabetes and gum disease.Here's how
        diabetes affects your teeth and oral health.
        Certain medications: Medications like antihistamines, antidepressants, some seizure medications,
        immune-suppressants, chemotherapy drugs and medicines for high blood pressure and birth control products are
        some drugs that cause gum bleeding, dry mouth and ulcers, making you susceptible to gum disease. Read more about
        gum problems due to medications.
        Hormonal changes: You may suffer from gum disease due to hormonal changes that mainly occur during puberty,
        pregnancy and menstruation.
        Stress: When you are stressed out, there is an increased production of hormones that reduce saliva production
        and also decrease immunity thereby predisposing you to gum disease. </p>

    <h2 class='disease-title'>Heart Attack</h2>
    <p id='desc_35' class='disease-description'>he muscles of your heart constantly need oxygen-rich blood which is
        ensured by your coronary arteries. This blood supply gets blocked when your arteries become narrow due to the
        build-up of plaque. It is formed by fat, calcium, proteins, and inflammatory cells. The outer layer of the
        plaque deposit is hard while the inner layer is soft. The outer shell breaks in case the plaque is hard. This is
        known as rupture, a condition that leads to the formation of blood clots around the plaque. If a blood clot
        blocks your artery, then blood supply to your heart is cut which, in turn, depletes the cardiac muscles of
        oxygen. This causes the muscle to die, resulting in permanent damage. The intensity of damage depends on the
        time gap between treatment and the attack. After a heart attack the cardiac muscles start repairing themselves.
        On an average, it takes them about 2 months to heal. Apart from this, there could be another condition that can
        lead to a heart attack: Spasm in your coronary artery (ischemia). This can also restrict blood supply to the
        heart and can occur even if you don't have any coronary artery disease. However, this is a rare occurrence.</p>

        then it fights infections. When liver is also inflamed or even damaged, its function could be affected. With
        Heavy alcohol use, consuming toxins, and some medications, there are certain medical conditions that will cause

    <p id='desc_37' class='disease-description'>Lack of safe water and poor sanitation are the main predisposing factors
        of Hepatitis A. The virus spreads by the faeco-oral route and is transmitted through food and water contaminated
        with infected faeces or by foods prepared by an infected person. Insufficiently cooked shellfish is another
        common source. It can also be acquired through close personal contact with an infected individual or through
        certain unsafe sex practices. Less commonly, sewage-contaminated water can cause waterborne epidemics of the
        disease.

        Once ingested, the virus enters the blood through the inner lining of the intestine and reaches the liver where
        it multiplies. It is then secreted into the bile and released in stool. The incubation period, i.e. time between
        first contact with the virus and development of symptoms, of the virus is usually 14-28 days and is the most

        symptoms in a majority of children aged below five years and in adults with a weakened immune system. However,
        the symptoms are often seen in 30-50% of infected people above five years of age. Some of the common symptoms of

        it can also develop in the groins, thighs, near the belly button or even in the lungs. The symptoms of hernia
        include lower abdominal pain, cough and pressure in the abdomen. Surgery is the only option available to get rid
        of such a problem. One of the most glaring and important symptoms is the formation of a bulge or lump on the
        surface of the body associated with pain. This usually happens only in areas like the stomach, groin or a part
        that has had some kind of surgical procedure. Other signs include a painful swelling that does not reduce on its
        own or on being pushed back, nausea, vomiting and abdominal bloating. If left untreated, apart from being
        extremely painful and uncomfortable it can lead to twisting or torsion of the part that come out of the
        herniated space. If that is not treated at the earliest, the organ can die and become gangrenous which can then

        be life threatening. Oral cancer is caused due to various factors such as -
        Tobacco use - Most cases of oral cancer are linked to one or the other form of tobacco use (cigarettes,
        smokeless tobacco, chewing tobacco, dipping snuff, cigars, bidis, etc.). The longer the duration you use these,
        the higher the risk. Tobacco contains around 4,000 chemical constituents among which more than two dozen are
        known carcinogens (cancer-causing chemicals). It is the single biggest culprit in the development of almost all
        pre-cancerous lesions. In India, the incidence of head and neck cancers is extremely high due to rampant
        tobacco-chewing habit in the form of gutka, quid, misri, snuff, etc. Read about tobacco-free world — imagine a
        world without cancer, heart disease and unwanted deaths!
        Alcohol consumption - Heavy alcohol use is another big culprit. Alcohol is known to irritate the lining inside
        the mouth or gums to a certain extent. And the risk increases if you use both alcohol and tobacco. Here are few
        side effects of alcohol everyone should know about.
        Lack of vitamin D - Sunlight helps the skin produce vitamin D and facilitates calcium absorption by the body.
        But did you know that sun exposure over long periods of time may increase the risk of lip cancer?
        Nutritional deficiency - Some studies also suggest that not eating enough fruits and vegetables may increase the
        chance of getting oral cancer. Read about top nutritional deficiencies in India.
        Chronic irritation - From rough teeth, dentures, fillings, etc. has been considered to a risk factor for
        Leukoplakia (a premalignant lesion).
        Human Papilloma Viruses - (HPV 16 and HPV 18) which cause cervical cancer are also being linked to cancer of the
        oropharynx (throat, base of tongue, tonsils and soft palate). These viruses are passed from person to person
        through sexual contact. Cancer at the base of the tongue, at the back of the throat, in the tonsils or in the
        soft palate may be linked with HPV infection.</p>

    <h2 class='disease-title'>Ovarian cysts</h2>
    <p id='desc_50' class='disease-description'>Ovaries, an essential part of the female reproductive system, produce
        eggs or ova and secrete both oestrogen and progesterone. These hormones are responsible for the development of
        the female body and regulate the menstrual cycle; moreover, they play an important part in pregnancy. In the
        ovaries, cysts are small sac-like structures that might contain water, gas or semi-solid substances and might
        not necessarily represent a tumour. Ovarian cysts can be physiological, benign or malignant. Often, these cysts
        seem to be asymptomatic and remain tucked in the organ without showing any signs or symptoms. A woman might not
        even know that she has developed cysts until it is too late and requires urgent treatment. Not all cysts require
        a surgical procedure. There are two possible complications associated with ovarian cysts.
        Rupture of the ovarian cyst: Ovarian cysts do spontaneously rupture; however, in rare instances, there could be
        bleeding depending on the size of the blood vessels involved, which could call for medical care. The presence of
        sharp, sudden pain in the lower belly may indicate that an ovarian cyst has ruptured. This can lead to
        considerable amount of blood and fluid loss from the body. In certain cases, the rupture of a cyst may not cause
        any symptoms.
        Ovarian torsion: Ovarian torsion is the blockage of blood supply to the ovary because of the twisting of the
        fallopian tube by the ovarian cyst; it is a rare medical emergency.</p>

        especially the spinal cord. Causes include stroke, trauma, nerve damage, polio, multiple sclerosis, etc.
        Paralysis can occur either partially or fully. Lower half paralysis is called paraplegia and paralysis of both
        arms and legs is called quadriplegia. It happens because the brain can't send messages to the different parts of
        the body for various reasons. If the nerve fibres are damaged the paralysis is usually irreversible.</p>

    <p id='desc_52' class='disease-description'>People with Parkinson's disease suffer loss of nerve cells in the brain
        that are responsible for releasing a brain chemical or neurotransmitter called dopamine. Dopamine is a
        signalling chemical required for coordination and control of body movements.
        Once the neurons start dying, the production of dopamine is reduced causing loss of movement control and
        coordination in people suffering from the condition. But what exactly triggers death of those neurons is still a
        mystery. Scientists have found out several genes that were responsible for causing the disease in some cases.
        Large population studies have indicated that people who have a family member or a relative suffering from the
        disease have a higher chance of developing the condition themselves. However, this is just an observation and
        further research on the inheritance aspect of Parkinson's disease is underway. In Parkinson's disease the basic
        characteristic symptoms are those of tremors (trembling or shaking), stiffness, and slowness of movement, these
        are called motor symptoms. The non-motor symptoms might include difficulties in maintaining posture and balance,
        soft speech, problems with urinating, slow bowel movements and sleep disturbances. A characteristic of
        Parkinson's is that the symptoms can change from day to day and sometimes even from hour to hour. Oral
        medications to a certain extent can help manage Parkinson's symptoms. But remember as one ages and the disease
        advances, medication alone won't be of help to control the symptoms. The effects of oral medications wane out
        with the progression of the disease but they are the first line of treatment in managing Parkinson's disease
        like Levodopa, Dopmanine agonists, MAO-B, COMT Inhibitors.</p>

    <p id='desc_53' class='disease-description'>Pericarditis is a disorder in which inflammation of the pericardium
        occurs. The pericardium is a sac or membrane-like structure comprising two thin layers of tissue around the
        heart. The function of the pericardium is to protect and lubricate the heart and keep it in its position; the
        pericardium also ensures the proper functioning of the heart, The space between the two thin layers is filled
        with fluid to avoid friction while the heartbeats. Therefore, these two layers move against each other without
        any irritation. The primary sign of pericarditis is chest pain as pericardium inflammation causes rubbing the
        pericardium against the heart. The pain can be similar to the pain felt in a heart attack. Pericarditis can be
        acute (lasts for a shorter period) or chronic (lasts for longer, i.e., it develops over time). Both acute and
        chronic pericarditis impair the heart's functioning. Rarely, pericarditis can lead to serious consequences,
        including abnormal heart rhythm and/or death. In most cases, mild pericarditis occurs, which subsides on its own
        with rest or primary treatment. Men between 16 years to 65 years of age are at a higher risk of contracting
        pericarditis. Early diagnosis of pericarditis can prevent further complications.</p>

    <h2 class='disease-title'>Peripheral vascular disease</h2>
    <p id='desc_54' class='disease-description'>Peripheral vascular disease is caused by narrowing or blockage of blood
        vessels supplying blood to the limbs due to deposition of fatty substances, cholesterol and other cellular waste
        on the walls of blood vessels to harden and form a plaque (also known as atherosclerosis). As a result, blood
        supply to the limbs is obstructed or reduced, making it difficult for the person to perform physical activities.
        Symptoms are: Decreased blood supply leads to pain in the affected limbs called as claudication. Initially, the
        pain occurs only with exertion but later as the disease progresses the person may feel severe pain even while
        resting. Apart from pain in the limbs, there can be local and trophic changes in the affected limb like pallor
        (paleness of the skin), redness, motor paralysis (in ability to perform daily function like moving the limb),
        loss of hair and ulcers over the skin. PVD is a treatable condition in most of the cases, says Dr Vineet. The
        goal of the treatment is to relieve claudication (lowered blood flow to the limbs during exercise) and prevent
        severe blockage that might lead to gangrene and limb amputation. A patient can either be treated with medication
        or surgery, depending on the severity of the condition.</p>

        to other parts of the body and are difficult to treat. It usually presents with difficulty and pain during
        urination, blood in the urine, along with sexual dysfunction. Advanced cases may present with bone pain in
        addition to the urinary symptoms. Prostate cancer is very rare before the age of 40, but the risk increases with
        age. Most cases are detected in the late 60s. It usually presents with difficulty and pain during urination,
        blood in the urine, along with sexual dysfunction. There may be no symptoms in many early cases, and it may be
        detected incidentally on performing a rectal exam, blood test, scan and biopsy. Advanced cases may present with
        bone pain in addition to the urinary symptoms. Surgery: The operation performed to remove the cancerous tissue
        is called Radical prostatectomy. Depending on the extent, patient factors and expertise available, it can be
        performed via a fairly long cut in the abdomen, keyhole surgery (laparoscopically) or even with Robotic surgical
